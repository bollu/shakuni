A minimal probabilstic programming DSL for haskell with currently a single
primitive, `sample01` --- to sample from a uniform distribution.


This was an exercise in learning probabilistic programming, sampling theory,
and minimal requirements for the above.

Might involve some exploration of parallelism of these computations.
